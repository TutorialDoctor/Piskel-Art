1. Set canvas to 64x64 (remember that the head is roughly 5 pixels high).
2. Draw a stick figure of the character. Place **points** at key angle changes to get an idea of where **lines** will be drawn (Ex. the shoulders, hips, knees, feet etc.) Think "joints." When drawing the sticks, don't draw them as interior lines, but draw them as outlines. For example, for the leg, the stick represents the outline of the thigh, knee and shin, not simply the direction of the leg.
3. Next, draw **triangles** to suggest shape (Ex. Draw a triangle from the hip to the knee to suggest the thigh.
4. Fill in the shapes with a skin **color**
5. After the 3rd step, change the canvas size to 128x128 and draw a **silhouette** of the character in all black. Keep the head in the flesh tones.
6. Scribble in the shape of the arms or legs using different **shades** to suggest shadows.
7. From there on, add **details**.

**Note**: When trying to figure out shapes, I usually outline the muscles with contrasting color and then fill in the shape with either the flesh or clothing tones (see the pants with the white outlines).

**Note:** I googled "pose" to find a pose to work with from.

**With a few tweaks (knowing the key differences between male and female) you can use the same frames to create a female (her neck should be shorter).**
